# 🚀 Use Case

  Most PDF editors are either:

   - Too basic → they only let you view or add plain text, no drawing.
   - Too expensive → locked behind subscriptions like Adobe.

  But for a lot of people, including myself and my piano teacher, the biggest need is simply filling out forms 
  like job applications, government paperwork, school/scholarship forms, leases, etc.

  That’s exactly why I made this project:
    So people who don't have establsihed methods of pdf editing
    can have access to a free, no-subscription, in-between PDF editor made just for form filling.

# ✨ Features:

  - 📝 Fill out PDF forms easily
  - 🔒 Secure — your files never leave your session
    (You need to set up a quick login to secure your filled forms, as they may contain sensitive info)
  - Works in the browser 
  - 100% free, no subscription required

- Frontend: React, JavaScript
